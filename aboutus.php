            Now known as <strong>IPMA-HROK</strong>, known as <strong>OPHRA</strong> from 2003-2016, and originally known as <strong>OPPA</strong>, the organization was founded in 1976 and extends membership to personnel professionals from all levels of the public sector including federal, state, county, and municipal governments, as well as school districts.
